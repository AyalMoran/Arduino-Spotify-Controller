# Arduino-Spotify-Controller
The system employs an Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller and four Ultrasonic sensors (PING))) to interpret human gestures and relay appropriate commands to Spotifyâ€™s API. The project seamlessly integrates hardware simulation on TinkerCAD and data scraping from the serial monitor of TinkerCAD using Python.
